DesertBot
=========

A community project to merge some of the bots running for the DesertBus community. The project is a WiP. More relevant information will be added here as time goes on.

To poke around with it, do the following:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtualenv and activate it. Be sure to use Python 3 as the interpreter.
3. Within the virtualenv, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Keep in mind that if you're doing this on Windows, you're going to need the VC9 compiler to build Twisted.
4. Run the bot using `python3 start.py`

For any bug reports, comments or talk about the bot, drop by in the #desertbot channel on heufneutje.net (port 6667)
