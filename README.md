DesertBot
=========

A community IRC bot written in Python 2, using Twisted at its backend. Its purpose is to merge some of the bots running
for the DesertBus community. The project is a WiP. More relevant information will be added here as time goes on.

To poke around with it, do the following:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtualenv. You will have to download virtualenv for Python 2 if you do not already have it. 
You could also just install the requirements on your machine itself, but a virtualenv is easier to work with.
3. Once the virtualenv is activated, run pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Create a config file and run python app.py.

For any bug reports, comments or talk about the bot, drop by in the #desertbus channel on irc.dbcommunity.org at port 6667
(or 6697 for SSL)
